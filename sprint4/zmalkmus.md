### What you accomplished
This sprint was spent mostly on finishing up some of the details on the frontend. First I worked on updating the login display to make it uniform with the rest of the webpage. I mainly looked at the signup page to do this, and it was a pretty straightforward task. Then I added an error message to be displayed on login failure when that was finished, this took some work to get formatted how I wanted it since I haven't used the alert box before. Finally I created the landing page and used ai to generate the images for the background. This is where I spent most of my time this sprint. I seperated each section using the mui grid feature, added some details, and I was meticulous in making it look the way I wanted.

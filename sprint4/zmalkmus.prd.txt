Background:
  Sometimes its hard to keep track of tasks you have to do in your day to day lives and organize your productivity based on importance so you get the stuff you want to   get done before the menial, unimportant tasks. Sometimes the tasks are too large and complex to reasonably keep track of without writing it down. This application
  would solve a variety of problems in prioritizing, and managing one's time.

Product Overview:
  The website will allow a user to create an account and add a new project to get started. They will be given the option to edit the name and description of the
  project, and add tasks corresponding to the project according to their needs. When the user completes an item, they can mark is as complete by pressing the checkmark   and all subtasks will be marked as complete as well. When all subtasks are completed, or the project itself is marked as complete, the project will visually update
  as  completed for the user. The site will also feature the most recent projects being worked on, as well as another tab for an extended list of projects. The site
  will   overall have a landing, log in, sign up, home, and projects page to be navigated by the end user.

### Files you worked on

- frontend/src/components/ProjectHeader/index.tsx
- frontend/src/components/ProjectDescPopUp/index.tsx

### What you accomplished
At this point in our project most of the things central to the project were already finished so there wasn't a whole lot left to do, most everything was pretty much
just polishing up some things that were a bit wonky or adding some things we overlooked. I noticed that despite our projects and tasks taking a description field
there was as of yet no way to actually see these descriptions. So I decided to go ahead and make the task descriptions visable under each task on the project page
and for the project's description to be displayed under the title. I then also added little dialogue buttons on the projects page that would pop up the project's 
description when clicked.

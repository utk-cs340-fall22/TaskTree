### What you accomplished
This sprint was mainly putting the finishing touches on the website -- it would have been presentable without these changes, but I worked on improving the user experience.
I added different greeting text depending on whether you had open projects, no open projects, or no projects, and added skeleton loaders that display an outline of what a
page would look like once it loads. I also added a separate view for a completed project (gray-ed out text, marked as green) and added confetti whenever a user
completes a project.

### Files you worked on
* tasktree\backend\TaskTree\Models\Task.cs
* tasktree\backend\TaskTree\Models\Project.cs
* tasktree\backend\TaskTree\Models\TaskTreeContext.cs
* Also setup the VS 2022 project but that is too many files most of which are auto-generated so I won't list them here.

### What you accomplished

I set up VS 2022 with appropriate extensions and set up VS 2022 project. I created the schema (model files) for tasks and projects, and set up the entity associations for each so that they work correctly with our SQL database.

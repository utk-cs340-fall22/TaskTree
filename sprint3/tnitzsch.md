# Sprint 3
* Name: Tyler Nitzsche
* Id: tnitzsch
* Group name: Tasktree

### What you planned to do
* Configure task dropdown component (issue #143: https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/143)
* Make a task list item component (issue #73: https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/73)
* Add project list item component (issue #91: https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/91)
* Add project header component (issue #75: https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/75)

### What you did not do
* Task 143 was completed by Zavier

### What problems you encountered
Still generally new to web development, so general difficulties from not really knowing what I was doing. Main issue was there was a lot of dependencies on my
tasks, and I was not told about all the dependencies on me which caused some timing issues.

### Issues you worked on
* (#75): https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/75
* (#73): https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/73
* (#91): https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/91

### Files you worked on
(Give a bulleted list of the files in your github repo that you worked on. Give the full pathname.)
* frontend/src/components/ProjectItem/index.tsx
* frontend/src/components/ProjectHeader/index.tsx
* frontend/src/components/TaskItem/index.tsx
* frontend/src/pages/project.tsx
* frontend/src/components/Project/index.tsx

### What you accomplished
This sprint as with my prior sprints was focused on frontend, most of what I did was setting up components for others to add functionality to, though header
was an actual display piece.

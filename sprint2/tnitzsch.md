# Sprint 2

* Name: Tyler Nitzsche
* NetId: tnitzsch
* Group Name: TaskTree

### What you planned to do
* Make a display projects page [#72](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/72)
* Make a create project popup [#68](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/68)
* Make a project page [#109](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/109)
* Make a create project form component [#71](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/71)
* Make a task list item component [#73](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/73)
* Make a task list component [#74](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/74)
* Make a project header component [#75](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/75)

### What you did not do
* Make a create project form component (code for it was written as part of a separate component, didn't think I needed to make it it's own component)
* Make a task list item component (code for it was written as part of a separate component, didn't think I needed to make it it's own component)
* Make a task list component (code for it was written as part of a separate component, didn't think I needed to make it it's own component)
* Make a project header component

### What problems you encountered
* I still struggled with the issues of not being super familiar with web development but to a much lesser degree than last time. I had some issues with finding
  how to do certain things in typescript vs javascript, since typescript seems to be much less common. Though it is mostly the same as JS, there were some differences
  that caused issue. Also just time, coming out of having to prepare for the 360 exam into making time for this was a bit rough.

* [#72](https://github.com/scrumzone/tasktree/issues/41)
